#### Bonus: Let’s use `fitted()` this time.

We just made those plots using various wrangled versions of `post`, the
data frame returned by `posterior_samples(b.13.4)`. If you followed
along closely, part of what made that a great exercise is that it forced
you to consider what the various vectors in `post` meant with respect to
the model formula. But it’s also handy to see how to do that from a
different perspective. So in this section, we’ll repeat that process by
relying on the `fitted()` function, instead. We’ll go in the same order,
starting with the average actor.

``` r
nd <- distinct(d, treatment)

(
  f <-
  fitted(b13.4,
         newdata = nd,
         re_formula = NA,
         probs = c(.1, .9)) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  bind_cols(nd) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = factor(treatment, labels = labels))
)
```

    ##    Estimate Est.Error       Q10       Q90 treatment
    ## 1 0.6039864 0.1519271 0.3997364 0.7952008       R/N
    ## 2 0.7111121 0.1355745 0.5293721 0.8676832       L/N
    ## 3 0.5284151 0.1584498 0.3213219 0.7336165       R/P
    ## 4 0.6899462 0.1396600 0.5018703 0.8558593       L/P

You should notice a few things. Since `b13.4` is a cross-classified
multilevel model, it had three predictors: `treatment`, `block`, and
`actor`. However, our `nd` data only included the first of those three.
The reason `fitted()` permitted that was because we set `re_formula =
NA`. When you do that, you tell `fitted()` to ignore group-level effects
(i.e., focus only on the fixed effects). This was our `fitted()` version
of ignoring the `r_` vectors returned by `posterior_samples()`. Here’s
the plot.

``` r
p4 <-
  f %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = Estimate, group = 1)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Q10, ymax = Q90), fill = "blue") +
  geom_line(color = "orange1") +
  ggtitle("Average actor") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = 0:1) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = .5))

p4
```

For marginal of actor, we can continue using the same `nd` data. This
time we’ll be sticking with the default `re_formula` setting, which will
accommodate the multilevel nature of the model. However, we’ll also be
adding `allow_new_levels = T` and `sample_new_levels = "gaussian"`. The
former will allow us to marginalize across the specific actors and
blocks in our data and the latter will instruct `fitted()` to use the
multivariate normal distribution implied by the random effects. It’ll
make more sense why I say *multivariate* normal by the end of the \[next
chapter\]\[Adventures in Covariance\]. For now, just go with it.

``` r
(
  f <-
  fitted(b13.4,
         newdata = nd,
         probs = c(.1, .9),
         allow_new_levels = T,
         sample_new_levels = "gaussian") %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  bind_cols(nd) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = factor(treatment, labels = labels))
  )
```

    ##    Estimate Est.Error        Q10       Q90 treatment
    ## 1 0.5669440 0.3164396 0.09313059 0.9602404       R/N
    ## 2 0.6415670 0.3040294 0.15376498 0.9759026       L/N
    ## 3 0.5163563 0.3185851 0.07131934 0.9441273       R/P
    ## 4 0.6264702 0.3069770 0.13899862 0.9729268       L/P

Here’s our `fitted()`-based marginal of `actor` plot.

``` r
p5 <-
  f %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = Estimate, group = 1)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Q10, ymax = Q90), fill = "blue") +
  geom_line(color = "orange1") +
  ggtitle("Marginal of actor") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = 0:1) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = .5))

p5
```

We’ll have to amend our workflow a bit to make a `fitted()` version of
the third panel. First we redefine our `nd` data and execute the
`fitted()` code.

``` r
# how many simulated chimps would you like?
n_chimps <- 100

nd <- 
  distinct(d, treatment) %>% 
  # define 100 new actors
  expand(actor = str_c("new", 1:n_chimps),
         treatment) %>% 
  # this adds a row number, which will come in handy, later
  mutate(row = 1:n())

# fitted
set.seed(13)

f <-
  fitted(b13.4,
         newdata = nd,
         allow_new_levels = T,
         sample_new_levels = "gaussian",
         summary = F,
         nsamples = n_chimps)
```

Our `f` object will need a lot of wrangling. Before I walk out the
wrangling steps, we should reiterate what McElreath originally did in
the text (pp. 429–430). He based the new actors on the deviation scores
from `post$sigma_a`. That was the first working line in his **R** code
13.38. In the remaining lines in that code block, he used the model
formula to compute the actor-level trajectories. Then in his plot code
in **R** code 13.39, he just used the first 100 rows from that output.

In our `fitted()` code, above, we saved a little time and computer
memory by setting `nsamples = n_chimps`, which equaled 100. That’s
functionally the same as when McElreath used the first 100 posterior
draws in the plot. A difficulty for us is the way `brms::fitted()`
returns the output, the 100 new levels of `actor` and the four levels of
`treatment` are confounded in the 400 columns. In the code block, below,
the `data.frame()` through `left_join()` lines are meant to disentangle
those two. After that, we’ll make an `actor_number` variable, which
which we’ll filter the data such that the first row returned by
`fitted()` is only assigned to the new actor \#1, the second row is only
assigned to the new actor \#2, and so on. The result is that we have 100
new simulated actors, each of which corresponds to a different iteration
of the posterior draws from the fixed effects\[1\].

``` r
p6 <-
  f %>%
  data.frame() %>% 
  # name the columns by the `row` values in `nd`
  set_names(pull(nd, row)) %>% 
  # add an iteration index
  mutate(iter = 1:n()) %>% 
  # make it long
  pivot_longer(-iter, names_to = "row") %>% 
  mutate(row = as.double(row)) %>% 
  # add the new data
  left_join(nd, by = "row") %>% 
  # extract the numbers from the names of the new actors
  mutate(actor_number = str_extract(actor, "\\d+") %>% as.double()) %>% 
  # only keep the posterior iterations that match the `actor_number` values
  filter(actor_number == iter) %>% 
  # add the `treatment` labels
  mutate(treatment = factor(treatment, labels = labels)) %>% 
  
  # plot!
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = value, group = actor)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 1/2, color = "blue") +
  ggtitle("100 simulated actors") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = .5))

## Endnote

1.  The `fitted()` version of the code for the third panel is
    cumbersome. Indeed, this in one of those cases where it seems more
    straightforward to work directly with the `posterior_samples()`
    output, rather than with `fitted()`. The workflow in this section
    from previous editions of this ebook was more streamlined and
    superficially seemed to work. However, fellow researcher [Ladislas
    Nalborczyk](https://twitter.com/lnalborczyk) kindly pointed out I
    was taking 100 draws from one new simulated `actor`, rather than one
    simulated draw from 100 new levels of `actor`. To my knowledge, if
    you want 100 new levels of `actor` AND want each one to be from a
    different posterior iteration, you’ll need a lot of post-processing
    code when working with `fitted()`.
