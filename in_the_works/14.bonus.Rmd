## 14.6. ~~Summary~~ Bonus: Multilevel growth models and the MELSM

To this point in the chapter and most of the text, the data have largely had a cross-sectional feel. In fairness, we did incorporate an element of time with the cafÃ© example from model `b14.1` by looking at the differences between mornings and evenings. However, even then we collapsed across longer time spans, such as days, weeks, months, and so on. One of the two goals of this bonus section to provide a brief introduction multilevel models designed to express change over time. The particular brand of multilevel models we'll focus on are often called multilevel growth models. Though we will focus on simple linear models, this basic framework can be generalized along many lines. The second goal is to build on our appreciation of covariance structures by introducing a class of multilevel models designed to investigate variation in variation called the mixed-effects location scale models (MELSM). For our final model, we get a little fancy and fit a multivariate MELSM.

### 14.6.1. Borrow some data.

All the models in this bonus section are based on the preprint by @williamsBayesianMultivariateMixedeffects2019a, [*Bayesian multivariate mixed-effects location scale modeling of longitudinal relations among affective traits, states, and physical activity*](https://psyarxiv.com/4kfjp). Williams and colleagues' data and supporting scripts are available in the `example_analyses` folder from their OSF project at [https://osf.io/3bmdh/](https://osf.io/3bmdh/). You can also download the data from the [`data` folder](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse_2_ed/tree/master/data) of this ebook's GitHub repo.

Load the data.

```{r, eval = F}
dat <- 
  readr::read_csv("/Users/solomonkurz/Dropbox/Recoding Statistical Rethinking 2nd ed/data/m_melsm_dat.csv") %>% 
  mutate(day01 = (day - 2) / max((day - 2)))

glimpse(dat)
```

These data are from 193 participants.

```{r, eval = F}
distinct(dat, record_id) %>% 
  count()
```

Participants were asked to complete self-report ratings once a day for a few months. People varied by how many days they participated in the study, with number of days ranging from 8 to 99 and a median of 74.

```{r, eval = F}
dat %>% 
  count(record_id) %>% 
  summarise(median = median(n),
            min = min(n),
            max = max(n))
```

Here is a plot of that distribution.

```{r, eval = F}
dat %>% 
  count(record_id) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = n)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#B1934A") +
  scale_x_continuous("number of days", limits = c(0, NA)) +
  theme_pearl_earring()
```

Our primary variables of interest were taken from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS, @watsonPANASDevelopment1988], which is widely used in certain areas of psychology to measure mood or emotion. In this study, participants completed the PANAS once a day by endorsing the extent to which they experienced various positive (e.g., excited, inspired) and negative (e.g., upset, afraid) emotional states. These responses are summed into two scores: Positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). In the current data, the standardized versions of these scores are in the `P_A.std` and `N_A.std` columns, respectively. To get a sense of what these look like, here are the daily `N_A.std` scores from a random sample of 16 participants.

```{r, eval = F}
set.seed(14)

dat %>% 
  nest(data = c(X1, P_A.std, day, P_A.lag, N_A.lag, steps.pm, steps.pmd, N_A.std, day01)) %>% 
  sample_n(size = 16) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = N_A.lag)) +
  geom_line(color = "#80A0C7") +
  geom_point(color = "#FCF9F0", size = 1/2) +
  ylab("negative affect (standardized)") +
  facet_wrap(~record_id)
```

### 14.6.2. Conventional multilevel growth model.

In the social sciences, a typical way to analyze data like these is with a multilevel growth model in which participants vary in their intercepts (starting point) and time slopes (change over time). In the sample of the data, above, it looks like most participants have fairly constant levels of NA over time (i.e., near-zero slopes) but some (e.g., # 128 and 147) show some evidence of systemic decreases in NA (i.e., negative slopes). There is also some variation in starting points, though most of the participants in this subset of the data seemed to have endorsed relatively low levels of NA both at baseline and throughout the study.

We want a model that can capture those kinds of variation. Eventually, we will fit a model that accounts for both PA and NA. But to keep things simple while we're warming up, we will restrict our focus to NA. If we let $\text{NA}_{ij}$ be the standardized NA score for the $i$th participant on the $j$th day, our first Bayesian multilevel growth model will follow the form

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{NA}_{ij} & \sim \operatorname{Normal}\begin{pmatrix} \mu_{ij}, \sigma \end{pmatrix} \\
\mu_{ij}       & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{time}_{ij} + u_{0i} + u_{1i} \text{time}_{ij} \\
\sigma & = \sigma_\epsilon \\
\begin{bmatrix} u_{0i} \\ u_{1i} \end{bmatrix} & \sim \operatorname{MVNormal}\begin{pmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \mathbf S \mathbf R \mathbf S \end{pmatrix} \\
\mathbf S & = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_0 & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_1 \end{bmatrix} \\
\mathbf R & = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \rho_{12} \\ \rho_{21} & 1 \end{bmatrix} \\
\beta_0   & \sim \operatorname{Normal}(0, 0.2) \\
\beta_1   & \sim \operatorname{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\sigma_0 \text{ and } \sigma_1 & \sim \operatorname{Exponential}(1) \\
\sigma_\epsilon & \sim \operatorname{Exponential}(1) \\
\mathbf R & \sim \operatorname{LKJ}(2),
\end{align*}
$$

where $\beta_0$ is the intercept (i.e., starting point) and $u_{0i}$ captures variations in that intercept across participants. Similarly, $\beta_1$ is the slope depicting linear change in $\text{NA}$ across time and $u_{1i}$ captures variations in that linear change across participants. The $u_{0i}$ and $u_{1i}$ parameters are modeled as multivariate normal with zero means (i.e., they are deviations from the population parameters) and standard deviations $\sigma_0$ and $\sigma_1$. We express the correlation between those two group-level $\sigma$ parameters with $\mathbf R$, the symmetric correlation matrix. Here we just have one correlation, $\rho_{21}$, which is the same as $\rho_{12}$. Finally, variation not accounted for by the other parameters is captured by the single parameter $\sigma_\epsilon$, which is often just called $\epsilon$.

We have two variables measuring time in these data. The `day` variable measures time by integers, ranging from 2 to 100. To make it a little easier to set the priors and fit the model with Stan, we have a rescaled version of the variable, `day01`, which ranges from 0 to 1. In this way, $\beta_0$ is the value for the first day in the data set and $\beta_1$ is the expected change by the end of the collection (i.e., the 100th day). For consistency, we are largely following McElreath's weakly-regularizing approach to priors.

You may have noticed my statistical notation differs a bit from McElreath's, here. This notation is a blend of sensibilities from McElreath, Williams, and from the notation I used in [my translation](https://bookdown.org/content/4253/) of Singer and Willett's [-@singerAppliedLongitudinalData2003] text, [*Applied longitudinal data analysis: Modeling change and event occurrence*](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195152968.001.0001/acprof-9780195152968). I hope it's clear.

Here is how to fit the model with **brms**.

```{r, eval = F}
# 5.583446 mins
b14.12 <-
  brm(data = dat,
      family = gaussian,
      N_A.std ~ 1 + day01 + (1 + day01 | record_id),
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma),
                prior(lkj(2), class = cor)),
      iter = 3000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 14,
      file = "/Users/solomonkurz/Dropbox/Recoding Statistical Rethinking 2nd ed/fits/b14.12")
```

Check the summary.

```{r, eval = F}
print(b14.12)
```

Hopefully it makes sense that the population-level intercept ($\beta_0$) is near zero. It would be odd if it wasn't given these are standardized data. The coefficient for `day01` ($\beta_1$) is mildly negative, suggesting an overall trend for participants to endorse lower NA scores over time.

The two group-level $\sigma$ parameters are fairly large given the scale of the data. They suggest participants varied quite a bit in terms of both intercepts and slopes. They also have a moderate negative correlation, suggesting that participants with higher intercepts tended to have more negative slopes.

To get a sense of the model, we'll plot the posterior means for each participants' fitted trajectory across time (thin lines), along with the population-average trajectory (thick line).

```{r, eval = F}
nd <-
  dat %>% 
  distinct(record_id, day01)

fitted(b14.12,
       newdata = nd) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  bind_cols(nd) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = day01, y = Estimate, group = record_id)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 1/3, size = 1/3, color = "#8B9DAF") +
  geom_segment(x = 0, xend = 1,
               y = fixef(b14.12)[1, 1],
               yend = fixef(b14.12)[1, 1] + fixef(b14.12)[2, 1],
               size = 3, color = "#80A0C7") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, .5, 1)) +
  ylab("negative affect (standardized)")
```

If you look back up to the model summary from before the plot, the one parameter we didn't focus on was the lone `sigma` parameter at the bottom. That's our $\sigma_\epsilon$, which captures the individual variation not accounted for by the intercepts, slopes, and their correlation. An important characteristic of the conventional multilevel growth model is that $\sigma_\epsilon$ does not vary across persons, occasions, or other variables. To give a sense of why this might not be the best assumption, letâs take a focused look at the model implied trajectories for two participants. Here we will take cues from some Figure 4.8 from way back in [Section 4.4.3.5][Prediction intervals.]. We will plot the original data atop both the fitted lines and their 95% intervals, which expresses the mean structure, along with the 95% posterior predictive interval, which expresses the uncertainty of the $\sigma_\epsilon$ parameter.

```{r, eval = F}
nd <-
  dat %>% 
  filter(record_id %in% c(30, 115)) %>% 
  select(record_id, N_A.std, day01)

bind_cols(
  fitted(b14.12,
         newdata = nd) %>% 
    data.frame(),
  predict(b14.12,
          newdata = nd) %>% 
    data.frame() %>% 
    select(Q2.5:Q97.5) %>% 
    set_names("p_lower", "p_upper")
) %>% 
  bind_cols(nd) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = day01)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = Estimate, ymin = Q2.5, ymax = Q97.5),
              stat = "identity",
              fill = "#8B9DAF", color = "#8B9DAF", alpha = 1/2, size = 1/2) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = p_lower, ymax = p_upper),
              fill = "#8B9DAF", alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = N_A.std),
             color = "#8B9DAF") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, .5, 1)) +
  ylab("negative affect (standardized)") +
  facet_wrap(~record_id)
```

Because of our fixed $\sigma_\epsilon$ parameter, the 95% posterior predictive interval is the same width for both participants. Yet look how closely participant the data points for participant 30 cluster not only within the center region of the posterior prediction intervals, but also almost completely within the 95% interval for the fitted line. In contrast, notice how much more spread out the data points for participant 115 are, and how many of them extend well beyond the posterior predictive interval. This difference in variability is ignored by conventional growth models. However, there's no reason we can't adjust our model to capture this kind of person-level variability, too. Enter the MELSM.

### 14.6.3. Learn more about your data with the MELSM.

Mixed-effects location scale models (MELSMs) have their origins in the work of [Donald Hedeker](https://health.uchicago.edu/faculty/donald-hedeker-phd) and colleagues  [@hedekerApplicationMixedeffectsLocation2008; @hedekerModelingWithinsubjectVariance2012]. @rastModelingIndividualDifferences2012 showcased an early application of the framework to the BUGS/JAGS software. More recently [Philippe Rast](https://twitter.com/rastlab) and colleagues (particularly graduate student, [Donald Williams](wdonald_1985)) have adapted this approach for use within the Stan/**brms** software ecosystem [@williamsBayesianNonlinearMixedeffects2019a; @williamsSurfaceUnearthingWithinperson2019; @williamsBayesianMultivariateMixedeffects2019a; @williamsPuttingIndividualReliability2019].

Within the **brms**, MELSMs apply a distributional modeling approach [see @BÃ¼rkner2020Distributional] to the multilevel growth model. Not only are parameters from the mean structure allowed to vary across groups, but parameters applied to $\sigma$ are allowed to vary across groups, too. Do you remember the little practice model `b10.1` from [Section 10.2.2][Linking linear models to distributions.]. We simulated Gaussian data for two groups with the same mean parameter but different parameters for $\sigma$. If you check back in that section, you'll see that the **brms** default was to model $\log \sigma$ in that case. This is smart because when you define a model for $\sigma$, you want to use a link function that ensures the predictions will be stay at zero and above. The MELSM approach of Hedeker, Rast, Williams and friends applies this logic to $\sigma_\epsilon$ in multilevel growth models. However, not only can $\sigma_\epsilon$ vary across groups in a fixed-effects sort of way, we can use multilevel partial pooling, too.

To get a sense of what this looks like, we'll augment our previous model, but this time allowing $\sigma_\epsilon$ to vary across participants. You might express the updated statistical model as

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{NA}_{ij} & \sim \operatorname{Normal}\begin{pmatrix} \mu_{ij}, \sigma_{i} \end{pmatrix} \\
\mu_{ij} & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{time}_{ij} + u_{0i} + u_{1i} \text{time}_{ij} \\ 
\log \begin{pmatrix} \sigma_i \end{pmatrix} & = \eta_0 + u_{2i} \\
\begin{bmatrix} u_{0i} \\ u_{1i} \\ u_{2i} \end{bmatrix} & \sim \operatorname{MVNormal}\begin{pmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \mathbf S \mathbf R \mathbf S \end{pmatrix} \\
\mathbf S & = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \sigma_2 \end{bmatrix} \\
\mathbf R & = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \rho_{12} & \rho_{13} \\ \rho_{21} & 1 & \rho_{23} \\ \rho_{31} & \rho_{32} & 1 \end{bmatrix} \\
\beta_0   & \sim \operatorname{Normal}(0, 0.2) \\
\beta_1 \text{and } \eta_0 & \sim \operatorname{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\sigma_0,..., \sigma_2     & \sim \operatorname{Exponential}(1) \\
\mathbf R & \sim \operatorname{LKJ}(2).
\end{align*}
$$

In the opening likelihood statement from the prior model, we simply set $\text{NA}_{ij} \sim \operatorname{Normal}\begin{pmatrix} \mu_{ij}, \sigma \end{pmatrix}$. For our first MELSM, we now refer to $\sigma_i$, meaning the levels of variation not accounted for by the mean structure can vary across participants (hence the $i$ subscript). Two lines down, we see the formula for $\log \begin{pmatrix} \sigma_i \end{pmatrix}$ contains population-level intercept, $\eta_0$, and participant-specific deviations around that parameter, $u_{2i}$. In the next three lines, the plot deepens. We see that all three participant-level deviations, $u_{0i},...,u_{2i}$ are multivariate normal with means set to zero and variation expressed in the parameters $\sigma_0,...,\sigma_2$ of the $\mathbf S$ matrix. In the $R$ matrix, we now have three correlation parameters, with $\rho_{31}$ and $\rho_{32}$ allowing us to assess the correlations among individual differences in variability and individual differences in starting points and change over time, respectively. Let's fit the model.

```{r, eval = F}
b14.13 <-
  brm(data = dat,
      family = gaussian,
      bf(N_A.std ~ 1 + day01 + (1 + day01 |i| record_id),
         sigma ~ 1 + (1 |i| record_id)),
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd),
                
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept, dpar = sigma),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd, dpar = sigma),
                
                prior(lkj(2), class = cor)),
      iter = 3000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 14,
      file = "/Users/solomonkurz/Dropbox/Recoding Statistical Rethinking 2nd ed/fits/b14.13")
```

We should note a few things about the `brm()` syntax. First, because we modeled both $\mu_{ij}$ and $\sigma_i$, we put both model formulas within the `bf()` function. Second, because the **brms** default is to use the log link when modeling $\sigma_i$, there was no need to explicitly set it that wah in the `family` line. However, we could have if we wanted to. Third, notice our use of the `|i|` syntax within the parentheses in the `formula` lines. If we had used the conventional `|` syntax, that would have not allowed our $u_{2i}$ parameters to correlate with $u_{0i}$ and $u_{1i}$ from the mean structure. It would have effectively set $\rho_{31} = \rho_{32} = 0$. Finally, notice how within the `prior()` functions, we explicitly referred to those for the new $\sigma$ structure with the `dpar = sigma` operator.

Okay, time to check the model summary.

```{r, eval = F}
print(b14.13)
```

The 'sigma_Intercept' lines in the 'Population-Level Effects' section is the summary for our $\eta_0$ parameter. To get a sense of what this means out of the log space, just exponentiate.

```{r, eval = F}
fixef(b14.13)["sigma_Intercept", c(1, 3:4)] %>% exp()
```

To get a sense of the variation in that parameter across participants [i.e., $\exp(\eta_0 + u_{2i})$], it's best to plot.

```{r, eval = F}
coef(b14.13)$record_id[, , "sigma_Intercept"] %>% 
  exp() %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  arrange(Estimate) %>% 
  mutate(rank = 1:n()) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = rank, y = Estimate, ymin = Q2.5, ymax = Q97.5)) +
  geom_pointrange(size = .4, fatten = .3, color = "#EEDA9D") +
  scale_x_continuous("participants ranked by posterior mean", breaks = NULL) +
  ylab(expression(exp(eta[0]+italic(u)[2][italic(i)])))
```

Looks like there's a lot of variation in a parameter that was formerly fixed across participants as a single value $\sigma_\epsilon$. Here's what this looks like in terms of our posterior predictive distributions for participants 30 and 115, from before.

```{r, eval = F}
nd <-
  dat %>% 
  filter(record_id %in% c(30, 115)) %>% 
  select(record_id, N_A.std, day01)

bind_cols(
  fitted(b14.13,
         newdata = nd) %>% 
    data.frame(),
  predict(b14.13,
          newdata = nd) %>% 
    data.frame() %>% 
    select(Q2.5:Q97.5) %>% 
    set_names("p_lower", "p_upper")
) %>% 
  bind_cols(nd) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = day01)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = Estimate, ymin = Q2.5, ymax = Q97.5),
              stat = "identity",
              fill = "#8B9DAF", color = "#8B9DAF", alpha = 1/2, size = 1/2) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = p_lower, ymax = p_upper),
              fill = "#8B9DAF", alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = N_A.std),
             color = "#8B9DAF") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, .5, 1)) +
  ylab("negative affect (standardized)") +
  facet_wrap(~record_id)
```

That's a big improvement. Let's expand our skill set. Within the MELSM paradigm, one can use multiple variables to model participant-specific variation. Here we'll add in our time variable.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{NA}_{ij} & \sim \operatorname{Normal}\begin{pmatrix} \mu_{ij}, \sigma_{ij} \end{pmatrix} \\
\mu_{ij} & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{time}_{ij} + u_{0i} + u_{1i} \text{time}_{ij} \\ \log \begin{pmatrix} \sigma_{ij} \end{pmatrix} & = \eta_0 + \eta_1 \text{time}_{ij} + u_{2i} + u_{3i} \text{time}_{ij} \\
\begin{bmatrix} u_{0i} \\ u_{1i} \\ u_{2i} \\ u_{3i} \end{bmatrix} & \sim \operatorname{MVNormal}\begin{pmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \mathbf S \mathbf R \mathbf S \end{pmatrix} \\
\mathbf S & = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \sigma_2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \sigma_3 \end{bmatrix} \\
\mathbf R & = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \rho_{12} & \rho_{13} & \rho_{14} \\ \rho_{21} & 1 & \rho_{23} & \rho_{24} \\ \rho_{31} & \rho_{32} & 1 & \rho_{34} \\ \rho_{41} & \rho_{42} & \rho_{43} & 1 \end{bmatrix} \\
\beta_0   & \sim \operatorname{Normal}(0, 0.2) \\
\beta_1, \eta_0, \text{and } \eta_1 & \sim \operatorname{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\sigma_0,..., \sigma_3 & \sim \operatorname{Exponential}(1) \\
\mathbf R & \sim \operatorname{LKJ}(2).
\end{align*}
$$

Note how in the very first line we are not speaking in terms of $\sigma_{ij}$. Variation in the criterion $\text{NA}_{ij}$ not accounted for by the mean structure can now vary across participants, $i$, and time, $j$. This results in four $u_{xi}$ terms, a $4 \times 4$ $\mathbf S$ matrix and a $4 \times 4$ $\mathbf R$ matrix. Here's how you might fit the model with `brms::brm()`. **Warning**: it'll probably take a couple hours.

```{r, eval = F}
b14.14 <-
  brm(data = dat,
      family = gaussian,
      bf(N_A.std ~ 1 + day01 + (1 + day01 |i| record_id),
         sigma ~ 1 + day01 + (1 + day01 |i| record_id)),
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd),
                
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept, dpar = sigma),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b, dpar = sigma),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd, dpar = sigma),
                
                prior(lkj(2), class = cor)),
      iter = 3000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 14,
      file = "/Users/solomonkurz/Dropbox/Recoding Statistical Rethinking 2nd ed/fits/b14.14")
```

At this point, `print()` is starting to return a lot of output. 

```{r, eval = F}
print(b14.14)
```

Our new line for 'sigma_day01' suggests there is a general trend for less variation in negative affect ratings over time. However, the 'sd(sigma_day01)' line in the 'Group-Level Effects' section indicates even this varies a bit across participants. At this point, a lot of the action is now in the estimates for the $\mathbf R$ matrix. Here that is in a coefficient plot.

```{r, eval = F}
posterior_summary(b14.14) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column("par") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(par, "cor_")) %>% 
  mutate(rho = str_c("(rho[", c(21, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43), "])")) %>% 
  mutate(par = str_c("'", par, "'~", rho)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = Estimate, xmin = Q2.5, xmax = Q97.5, y = par)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-.5, 0, .5), linetype = c(2, 1, 2), size = c(1/4, 1/2, 1/4), color = "#FCF9F0", alpha = 1/4) +
  geom_pointrange(color = "#B1934A") +
  xlim(-1, 1) +
  scale_y_discrete(labels = ggplot2:::parse_safe) +
  labs(x = "marginal posterior",
       y = NULL) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 9),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```

Note how we attached the statistical terms from the lower triangle of the $\mathbf R$ matrix to the names from the **brms** output. Coefficient plots like this are somewhat helpful with MELSM parameter summaries, like this. But they leave something to be desired and they wonât scale well. One alternative is to present the posterior means in a correlation matrix plot. Our first step to prepare for the plot is to extract and wrangle the posterior summaries.

```{r, eval = F}
levels <- c("beta[0]", "beta[1]", "eta[0]", "eta[1]")

r <-
  posterior_summary(b14.14) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column("param") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(param, "cor_")) %>% 
  mutate(param = str_remove(param, "cor_record_id__")) %>% 
  separate(param, into = c("left", "right"), sep = "__") %>% 
  mutate(
    left = case_when(
      left == "Intercept"       ~ "beta[0]",
      left == "day01"           ~ "beta[1]",
      left == "sigma_Intercept" ~ "eta[0]"),
    right = case_when(
      right == "day01"           ~ "beta[1]",
      right == "sigma_Intercept" ~ "eta[0]",
      right == "sigma_day01"     ~ "eta[1]"
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(label = formatC(Estimate, digits = 2, format = "f") %>% str_replace(., "0.", ".")) %>%
  mutate(left  = factor(left, levels = levels),
         right = factor(right, levels = levels)) %>%
  mutate(right = fct_rev(right))

r
```

Note how instead of naming the correlations in terms of $\rho_{xx}$, we are now referring to them as the correlations of the deviations among the population parameters, $\beta_0$ through $\eta_1$. I'm hoping this will make sense in the plot. Here it is.

```{r, eval = F}
r %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = left, y = right)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Estimate)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = label),
            family = "Courier", size = 3) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(expression(rho),
                       low = "#59708b", mid = "#FCF9F0", high = "#A65141", midpoint = 0, 
                       labels = c(-1, "", 0, "", 1), limits = c(-1, 1)) +
  scale_x_discrete(NULL, drop = F, labels = ggplot2:::parse_safe, position = "top") +
  scale_y_discrete(NULL, drop = F, labels = ggplot2:::parse_safe) +
  ggtitle(expression("The lower triangle for "*bold(R)),
          subtitle = "Note, each cell is summarized by\nits posterior mean.") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(hjust = 1))
```

Interestingly, the strongest two associations involve variation around our $\eta$ parameters. The posterior mean for $\rho_{31}$ indicates participants with higher baseline levels of $\text{NA}_{ij}$ tend to vary more in their responses, particularly in the beginning. The posterior mean for $\rho_{42}$ indicates participants who show greater increases in their $\text{NA}_{ij}$ responses over time also tend to show greater relative increases in variation in those responses. You can get a little bit of a sense for this by returning once again to our participants 30 and 115.

```{r, eval = F}
nd <-
  dat %>% 
  filter(record_id %in% c(30, 115)) %>% 
  # filter(record_id < 20) %>% 
  select(record_id, N_A.std, day01)

bind_cols(
  fitted(b14.14,
         newdata = nd) %>% 
    data.frame(),
  predict(b14.14,
          newdata = nd) %>% 
    data.frame() %>% 
    select(Q2.5:Q97.5) %>% 
    set_names("p_lower", "p_upper")
) %>% 
  bind_cols(nd) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = day01)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = Estimate, ymin = Q2.5, ymax = Q97.5),
              stat = "identity",
              fill = "#8B9DAF", color = "#8B9DAF", alpha = 1/2, size = 1/2) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = p_lower, ymax = p_upper),
              fill = "#8B9DAF", alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = N_A.std),
             color = "#8B9DAF") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, .5, 1)) +
  ylab("negative affect (standardized)") +
  facet_wrap(~record_id)
```

With respect to $\rho_{31}$, participant 115 showed both a higher intercept and level of variability toward the beginning of the study. The meaning of $\rho_{42}$ is less clear, with these two. But at least you can get a sense of why you might want to include a  $\eta_1$ parameter to allow response variability to change over time, and why you might want to allow that parameter to vary across participants. Whereas response variability increased quite a bit for participant 115 over time, it stayed about the same for participant 30, perhaps even decreasing a bit.

### 14.6.4. Time to go multivariate.

For our final stage in this progression, we will fit what @williamsBayesianMultivariateMixedeffects2019a called a M-MELSM, a multivariate mixed-effects location scale model. Recall these data have measures of both negative and positive affect. The standardized values for PA are waiting for us in the `P_A.std` column. Within the **brms** framework, this is a combination of sensibilities from BÃ¼rkner's vignettes on distributional models [@BÃ¼rkner2020Distributional] and multivariate models [@BÃ¼rkner2020Multivariate]. We might express the statistical model as

$$

where the $\text{NA}$ and $\text{PA}$ superscripts indicate which variable is connected with which parameter. This is a straight multivariate generalization from the previous model, `fit3`. Now we have eight parameters varying across participants, resulting in an $8 \times 8$ $\mathbf S$ matrix and an $8 \times 8$ $\mathbf R$ matrix. Here's the `brms::brm()` code. 

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# takes 3.460296 hours
```

```{r, eval = F}
b14.15 <-
  brm(data = dat,
      family = gaussian,
      bf(mvbind(N_A.std, P_A.std) ~ 1 + day01 + (1 + day01 |i| record_id),
         sigma ~ 1 + day01 + (1 + day01 |i| record_id)) + set_rescor(rescor = FALSE),
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept, resp = NAstd),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b, resp = NAstd),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd, resp = NAstd),
                
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept, dpar = sigma, resp = NAstd),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b, dpar = sigma, resp = NAstd),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd, dpar = sigma, resp = NAstd),
                
                prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept, resp = PAstd),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b, resp = PAstd),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd, resp = PAstd),
                
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept, dpar = sigma, resp = PAstd),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b, dpar = sigma, resp = PAstd),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd, dpar = sigma, resp = PAstd),

                prior(lkj(2), class = cor)),
      iter = 3000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 14,

```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
print(b14.15)
```

Note how we used the `resp` argument to indicate which priors went with which criterion variables. For the sake of space, I'll skip showing the `print()` output. By all means, check that summary out if you fit this model on your own. Though there may be some substantive insights to glean from looking at the population-level parameters and the hierarchical $\sigma$'s, I'd argue the main action is in the $\mathbf R$ matrix. This time we'll jump straight to showcasing their posterior means in a correlation matrix plot.

First we wrangle.

```{r, eval = F}
levels <- c("beta[0]^'NA'", "beta[1]^'NA'", "eta[0]^'NA'", "eta[1]^'NA'",
            "beta[0]^'PA'", "beta[1]^'PA'", "eta[0]^'PA'", "eta[1]^'PA'")

# two different options for ordering the parameters
# levels <- c("beta[0]^'NA'", "beta[1]^'NA'", "beta[0]^'PA'", "beta[1]^'PA'", "eta[0]^'NA'", "eta[1]^'NA'", "eta[0]^'PA'", "eta[1]^'PA'")
# levels <- c("beta[0]^'NA'", "beta[0]^'PA'", "beta[1]^'NA'", "beta[1]^'PA'","eta[0]^'NA'", "eta[0]^'PA'", "eta[1]^'NA'", "eta[1]^'PA'")

r <-
  posterior_summary(b14.15) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column("param") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(param, "cor_")) %>% 
  mutate(param = str_remove(param, "cor_record_id__")) %>% 
  separate(param, into = c("left", "right"), sep = "__") %>% 
  mutate(
    left = case_when(
      left == "NAstd_Intercept"       ~ "beta[0]^'NA'",
      left == "NAstd_day01"           ~ "beta[1]^'NA'",
      left == "sigma_NAstd_Intercept" ~ "eta[0]^'NA'",
      left == "sigma_NAstd_day01"     ~ "eta[1]^'NA'",
      left == "PAstd_Intercept"       ~ "beta[0]^'PA'",
      left == "PAstd_day01"           ~ "beta[1]^'PA'",
      left == "sigma_PAstd_Intercept" ~ "eta[0]^'PA'",
      left == "sigma_PAstd_day01"     ~ "eta[1]^'PA'"
      ),
    right = case_when(
      right == "NAstd_Intercept"       ~ "beta[0]^'NA'",
      right == "NAstd_day01"           ~ "beta[1]^'NA'",

      right == "PAstd_Intercept"       ~ "beta[0]^'PA'",
      right == "PAstd_day01"           ~ "beta[1]^'PA'",
      right == "sigma_PAstd_Intercept" ~ "eta[0]^'PA'",
      right == "sigma_PAstd_day01"     ~ "eta[1]^'PA'"
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(label = formatC(Estimate, digits = 2, format = "f") %>% str_replace(., "0.", ".")) %>% 
  mutate(left  = factor(left, levels = levels),
         right = factor(right, levels = levels)) %>% 
  mutate(right = fct_rev(right))

r %>% head()
```
      
Now we plot!

```{r, echo = F, eval = F}
# Easter egg for the super nerds
# 
# The color I used for the low end of the fill gradient, "#59708b", is not technically part of the `dutchmasters$pearl_earring` color palette. Originally, I wanted to use "#80A0C7", which is part of that palette. The difficulty, however, is the red used for the high end of the fill gradient has a lower lightness value, making the gradient look unbalanced. You can compare the stats for the red at https://www.color-hex.com/color/a65141 to the stats for blue at https://color-hex.org/color/80a0c7. Based on the aforementioned website for the blue color, the HEX color "#59708b" is two shades darker and, importantly, has the same lightness value as the red (see https://www.color-hex.com/color/606683).
```

```{r, eval = F}
r %>% 
  full_join(rename(r, right = left, left = right),
            by = c("left", "right", "Estimate", "Est.Error", "Q2.5", "Q97.5", "label")) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = left, y = right)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Estimate)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4.5, color = "#100F14") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4.5, color = "#100F14") +
  geom_text(aes(label = label),
            family = "Courier", size = 3) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(expression(rho),
                       low = "#59708b", mid = "#FCF9F0", high = "#A65141", midpoint = 0,
                       labels = c(-1, "", 0, "", 1), limits = c(-1, 1)) +
  scale_x_discrete(NULL, expand = c(0, 0), labels = ggplot2:::parse_safe, position = "top") +
  scale_y_discrete(NULL, expand = c(0, 0), labels = ggplot2:::parse_safe) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(hjust = 1))
```

The `full_join()` business just before the **ggplot2** code is how we got the full $8 \times 8$ matrix. If you're curious, see what happens if you run the code without that part.

To help orient you to the plot, Iâve divided it into four quadrants. The upper left and lower right quadrants are the correlations among the varying parameters for the `N_A.std` and `P_A.std` ratings, respectively. The other two quadrants are the correlations for those parameters between `N_A.std` and `P_A.std`. As a reminder, this matrix, as with any other correlation matrix, is symmetrical across the diagonal.

To my eye, a few things pop out. First, the correlations within `N_A.std` are generally higher than those within `P_A.std`. Second, the correlations among the parameters between `N_A.std` and `P_A.std` are generally higher than those within them. Finally, all three of the largest correlations have to do with variation in the $\eta$ parameters. Two of them are basically the same as those we focused on for `fit3`. The new one, $\rho_{73}$, indicates that participantsâ baseline ratings for `N_A.std` tended to vary in a similar way as their baseline ratings for `P_A.std`.

#### 14.6.4.1. Plot with uncertainty.

As fond as I am with that last correlation plot, it has a glaring defect: there is no expression of uncertainty. Sometimes we express uncertainty with percentile-based intervals. Other times we do so with marginal densities. But the correlation plots only describe the marginal posteriors for all the $\rho$ parameters with their means. No uncertainty. If you have one or a small few correlations to plot, coefficient or density plots might do. However, they don't scale well. If you don't believe me, just try. I'm not sure there are any good solutions to this, but it can be helpful to at least try grappling with the issue. 

Fortunately for us, [Matthew Kay](https://twitter.com/mjskay) (creator of the [**tidybayes** package](http://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes)) has already tried his hand at a few approaches. For all the deets, check out the [multivariate-regression.md](https://github.com/mjskay/uncertainty-examples/blob/master/multivariate-regression.md) file in his [uncertainty-examples](https://github.com/mjskay/uncertainty-examples) GitHub repo. One of his more imaginative approaches is to use what he calls dithering. Imagine breaking each of the cells in our correlation plot, above, into a $50 \times 50 = 2,500$-cell grid. Now assign each of the cells within that grid one of the values from the HMC draws of that correlation's posterior distribution. Then color code each of those cells by that value in the same basic way we color coded our previous correlation plots. Simultaneously do that for all of the correlations within the $\mathbf R$ matrix and plot them in a faceted plot. That's the essence of the dithering approach. This is all probably hard to make sense of in words. Hopefully it will all come together with a little code and the resulting plot. Hold on to your hat.

From Kay's GitHub repo, we read: "This is akin to something like an icon array. You should still be able to see the average color (thanks to the human visual system's ensembling processing), but also get a sense of the uncertainty by how 'dithered' a square looks." Hopefully this will give you a little inspiration to find new and better ways to express the posterior uncertainty in your Bayesian correlation plots. If you come up with any great solutions, let the rest of us know!

### 14.6.5. Growth model/MELSM wrap-up.

This section introduced a lot of material. To learn more about the conventional multilevel growth model and its extensions, check out
