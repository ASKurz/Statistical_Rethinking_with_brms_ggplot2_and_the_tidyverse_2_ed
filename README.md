# *Statistical Rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse. Second Edition

Welcome to the sister project of my [*Statistical Rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse). This project is an attempt to follow the same form as the original. Our aim is to translate the code from McElreath’s [second edition](http://elevanth.org/blog/2018/07/14/statistical-rethinking-edition-2-eta-2020/) to fit within a [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) framework. As with the first project, I’ll be slowly uploading .Rmd and .md documents of the chapters as I get to them. Once McElreath officially releases the second edition of the text and I’ve had enough time to polish up my code, I will eventually stitch these documents together in a [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) format, just like [my project](https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/Statistical_Rethinking_recoded/) for the first edition. Until then, tide yourself over with McElreath’s newest [lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJK6_DZvcMqNSzQdEkzvzA/playlists).
