Welcome to the sister project of my [*Statistical Rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse). Our aim is to translate the code from McElreath's [second edition](http://elevanth.org/blog/2018/07/14/statistical-rethinking-edition-2-eta-2020/) to fit within a [**brms**](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) and [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org) framework. The current 0.2.0 version contains drafts of all 17 chapters, which have been stitched together into a **bookdown** ebook, which you can access at [https://bookdown.org/content/4857/](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/). See issues [#16](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse_2_ed/issues/16) and [#17](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse_2_ed/issues/17) for the biggest unresolved problems.
