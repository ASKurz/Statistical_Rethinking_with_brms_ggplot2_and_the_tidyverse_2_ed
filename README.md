# *Statistical rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition

Welcome to the sister project of my [*Statistical Rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse). Our aim is to translate the code from McElreathâ€™s [second edition](http://elevanth.org/blog/2018/07/14/statistical-rethinking-edition-2-eta-2020/) to fit within a [**brms**](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) and [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org) framework. The first drafts of the first nine chapters have been stitched together into a **bookdown** ebook, which you can access at [https://bookdown.org/content/4857/](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/). You can find working drafts of other chapters in the [in_the_works](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse_2_ed/tree/master/in_the_works) folder.
