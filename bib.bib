  abstract = {A valuable overview of the most important ideas and results in statistical modeling Written by a highly-experienced author, Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models is a clear and comprehensive guide to the key concepts and results of linearstatistical models. The book presents a broad, in-depth overview of the most commonly usedstatistical models by discussing the theory underlying the models, R software applications,and examples with crafted models to elucidate key ideas and promote practical modelbuilding. The book begins by illustrating the fundamentals of linear models, such as how the model-fitting projects the data onto a model vector subspace and how orthogonal decompositions of the data yield information about the effects of explanatory variables. Subsequently, the book covers the most popular generalized linear models, which include binomial and multinomial logistic regression for categorical data, and Poisson and negative binomial loglinear models for count data. Focusing on the theoretical underpinnings of these models, Foundations ofLinear and Generalized Linear Models also features:  An introduction to quasi-likelihood methods that require weaker distributional assumptions, such as generalized estimating equation methods An overview of linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models with random effects for clustered correlated data, Bayesian modeling, and extensions to handle problematic cases such as high dimensional problems Numerous examples that use R software for all text data analyses More than 400 exercises for readers to practice and extend the theory, methods, and data analysis A supplementary website with datasets for the examples and exercises  An invaluable textbook for upper-undergraduate and graduate-level students in statistics and biostatistics courses, Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models is also an excellent reference for practicing statisticians and biostatisticians, as well as anyone who is interested in learning about the most important statistical models for analyzing data.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the `gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

  abstract = {Examination of aggregate data on graduate admissions to the University of California, Berkeley, for fall 1973 shows a clear but misleading pattern of bias against female applicants. Examination of the disaggregated data reveals few decision-making units that show statistically significant departures from expected frequencies of female admissions, and about as many units appear to favor women as to favor men. If the data are properly pooled, taking into account the autonomy of departmental decision making, thus correcting for the tendency of women to apply to graduate departments that are more difficult for applicants of either sex to enter, there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. The graduate departments that are easier to enter tend to be those that require more mathematics in the undergraduate preparatory curriculum. The bias in the aggregated data stems not from any pattern of discrimination on the part of admissions committees, which seem quite fair on the whole, but apparently from prior screening at earlier levels of the educational system. Women are shunted by their socialization and education toward fields of graduate study that are generally more crowded, less productive of completed degrees, and less well funded, and that frequently offer poorer professional employment prospects.},

  abstract = {Ordinal predictors are commonly used in regression models. They are often incorrectly treated as either nominal or metric, thus under- or overestimating the information contained. Such practices may lead to worse inference and predictions compared to methods which are specifically designed for this purpose. We propose a new method for modelling ordinal predictors that applies in situations in which it is reasonable to assume their effects to be monotonic. The parameterization of such monotonic effects is realized in terms of a scale parameter b representing the direction and size of the effect and a simplex parameter modelling the normalized differences between categories. This ensures that predictions increase or decrease monotonically, while changes between adjacent categories may vary across categories. This formulation generalizes to interaction terms as well as multilevel structures. Monotonic effects may be applied not only to ordinal predictors, but also to other discrete variables for which a monotonic relationship is plausible. In simulation studies we show that the model is well calibrated and, if there is monotonicity present, exhibits predictive performance similar to or even better than other approaches designed to handle ordinal predictors. Using Stan, we developed a Bayesian estimation method for monotonic effects which allows us to incorporate prior information and to check the assumption of monotonicity. We have implemented this method in the R package brms, so that fitting monotonic effects in a fully Bayesian framework is now straightforward.},

This practice can lead to distorted effect-size estimates, inflated error rates, and other problems. We argue for the application of ordinal models that make appropriate assumptions about the variables under study. In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.},

First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

Asking whether these principles are invoked to explain moral judgments, we found that subjects generally appealed to the first and third principles in their justifications, but not to the second. This finding has significance for methods and theories of moral psychology: The moral principles used in judgment must be directly compared with those articulated in justification, and doing so shows that some moral principles are available to conscious reasoning whereas others are not.},

Cross-validation can be an easy-to-use alternative to null-hypothesis testing, and it has the benefit that it does not make as many assumptions.},

In this paper we resolve this apparent paradox by placing the choice of prior into the context of the entire Bayesian analysis, from inference to prediction to model evaluation.},

We recommend researchers instead use estimators based on local linear or quadratic polynomials or other smooth functions.},

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

  abstract = {Model formulae represent a powerful methodology for describing, discussing, understanding, and performing the component of statistical tests known as linear statistics. It was developed for professional statisticians in the 1960s and has become increasingly available as the use of computers has grown and software has advanced. Modern Statistics for Life Scientists puts this methodology firmly within the grasp of undergraduates for the first time. The authors assume a basic knowledge of statistics--up to and including one and two sample t-tests and their non-parametric equivalents. They provide the conceptual framework needed to understand what the method does--but without mathematical proofs--and introduce the ideas in a simple and steady progression with worked examples and exercises at every stage.  This innovative text offers students a single conceptual framework for a wide range of tests-including t-tests, oneway and multiway analysis of variance, linear and polynomial regressions, and analysis of covariance-that are usually introduced separately. More importantly, it gives students a language in which they can frame questions and communicate with the computers that perform the analyses. A companion website, www.oup.com/grafenhails, provides a wealth of worked exercises in the three statistical languages; Minitab, SAS, and SPSS. Appropriate for use in statistics courses at undergraduate and graduate levels, Modern Statistics for the Life Sciences  is also a helpful resource for students in non-mathematics-based disciplines using statistics, such as geography, psychology, epidemiology, and ecology.},

In studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), up to 30 or 40 observations are often obtained for each subject, and interest frequently centers around changes in the variances, both within and between subjects. In this article, we focus on an adolescent smoking study using EMA where interest is on characterizing changes in mood variation. We describe how covariates can influence the mood variances, and also extend the standard mixed model by adding a subject-level random effect to the within-subject variance specification. This permits subjects to have influence on the mean, or location, and variability, or (square of the) scale, of their mood responses. Additionally, we allow the location and scale random effects to be correlated. These mixed-effects location scale models have useful applications in many research areas where interest centers on the joint modeling of the mean and variance structure.},

The lactation strategy of a species has four interrelated dimensions: the frequency and duration of nursing bouts, the period of lactation until weaning, the number and sex ratio of infants that a mother rears simultaneously, and the composition and yield of the milk that mothers synthesize. Milk synthesis, arguably the most physiologically costly component of rearing infants, remains the least studied. Energy transfer becomes energetically less efficient, transitioning from placental support to milk synthesis1, 2 just as the energy requirements for infant growth, development, and behavioral activity substantially increase. Here we review primate lactation biology and milk synthesis, integrating studies from anthropology, biology, nutrition, animal science, immunology, and biochemistry, to identify the derived and ancestral features of primate milks and enhance our understanding of primate life history.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal Analysis provides an accessible, application-oriented treatment of introductory and advanced linear models for within-person fluctuation and change. Organized by research design and data type, the text uses in-depth examples to provide a complete description of the model-building process. The core longitudinal models and their extensions are presented within a multilevel modeling framework, paying careful attention to the modeling concerns that are unique to longitudinal data. Written in a conversational style, the text provides verbal and visual interpretation of model equations to aid in their translation to empirical research results. Overviews and summaries, boldfaced key terms, and review questions will help readers synthesize the key concepts in each chapter.  Written for non-mathematically-oriented readers, this text features:   A description of the data manipulation steps required prior to model estimation so readers can more easily apply the steps to their own data   An emphasis on how the terminology, interpretation, and estimation of familiar general linear models relates to those of more complex models for longitudinal data    Integrated model comparisons, effect sizes, and statistical inference in each example to strengthen readers' understanding of the overall model-building process   Sample results sections for each example to provide useful templates for published reports   Examples using both real and simulated data in the text, along with syntax and output for SPSS, SAS, STATA, and Mplus at www.PilesOfVariance.com to help readers apply the models to their own data The book opens with the building blocks of longitudinal analysis\rule{1em}{1pt}general ideas, the general linear model for between-person analysis, and between- and within-person models for the variance and the options within repeated measures analysis of variance. Section 2 introduces unconditional longitudinal models including alternative covariance structure models to describe within-person fluctuation over time and random effects models for within-person change. Conditional longitudinal models are presented in section 3, including both time-invariant and time-varying predictors. Section 4 reviews advanced applications, including alternative metrics of time in accelerated longitudinal designs, three-level models for multiple dimensions of within-person time, the analysis of individuals in groups over time, and repeated measures designs not involving time. The book concludes with additional considerations and future directions, including an overview of sample size planning and other model extensions for non-normal outcomes and intensive longitudinal data.  Class-tested at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and in intensive summer workshops, this is an ideal text for graduate-level courses on longitudinal analysis or general multilevel modeling taught in psychology, human development and family studies, education, business, and other behavioral, social, and health sciences. The book's accessible approach will also help those trying to learn on their own. Only familiarity with general linear models (regression, analysis of variance) is needed for this text.},

  abstract = {Psychology research focuses on interactions, and this has deep implications for inference from non-representative samples. For the goal of estimating average treatment effects, we propose to fit a model allowing treatment to interact with background variables and then average over the distribution of these variables in the population. This can be seen as an extension of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP), a method used in political science and other areas of survey research, where researchers wish to generalize from a sparse and possibly non-representative sample to the general population. In this paper, we discuss areas where this method can be used in the psychological sciences. We use our method to estimate the norming distribution for the Big Five Personality Scale using open source data. We argue that large open data sources like this and other collaborative data sources can be combined with MRP to help resolve current challenges of generalizability and replication in psychology.},

  abstract = {The direction of an association at the population-level may be reversed within the subgroups comprising that population\textemdash a striking observation called Simpson's paradox. When facing this pattern, psychologists often view it as anomalous. Here, we argue that Simpson's paradox is more common than conventionally thought, and typically results in incorrect interpretations \textendash{} potentially with harmful consequences. We support this claim by drawing on empirical results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, psychopathology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson's Paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered\textemdash including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson's Paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world.},

  abstract = {Much human adaptation depends on the gradual accumulation of culturally transmitted knowledge and technology. Recent models of this process predict that large, well-connected populations will have more diverse and complex tool kits than small, isolated populations. While several examples of the loss of technology in small populations are consistent with this prediction, it found no support in two systematic quantitative tests. Both studies were based on data from continental populations in which contact rates were not available, and therefore these studies do not provide a test of the models. Here, we show that in Oceania, around the time of early European contact, islands with small populations had less complicated marine foraging technology. This finding suggests that explanations of existing cultural variation based on optimality models alone are incomplete because demography plays an important role in generating cumulative cultural adaptation. It also indicates that hominin populations with similar cognitive abilities may leave very different archaeological records, a conclusion that has important implications for our understanding of the origin of anatomically modern humans and their evolved psychology.},

  abstract = {Previous research on food sharing in small-scale societies provides support for multiple evolutionary hypotheses, but evolutionary anthropologists have devoted relatively little attention to the broader relational context of inter-household transfers of food. The present research observes transfers of meat over a yearlong period among 25 households of indigenous Mayangna and Miskito horticulturalists in Nicaragua. To analyze these data, we extend the multilevel formulation of the social relations model to count data, namely the number of portions of meat exchanged between households. Along with other covariates, we examine the effect of an ``association index,'' which reflects the amount of time that households interact with one another. The association index exhibits a positive effect on sharing, and our overall results indicate that food sharing networks largely correspond to kin-based networks of social interaction, suggesting that food sharing is embedded in broader social relationships between households. We discuss possible extensions of our methodological approach, as appropriate for research on food sharing and social network analysis more broadly.},

Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.  The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.  The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.  Features   Integrates working code into the main text   Illustrates concepts through worked data analysis examples   Emphasizes understanding assumptions and how assumptions are reflected in code   Offers more detailed explanations of the mathematics in optional sections   Presents examples of using the dagitty R package to analyze causal graphs   Provides the rethinking R package on the author's website and on GitHub},

In this comment, I discuss some of these issues from a scientific perspective. What goal does model selection serve when all models are known to be systematically wrong? How might ``toy problems'' tell a misleading story? How does the scientific goal of explanation align with (or differ from) traditional statistical concerns? I do not offer answers to these questions, but hope to highlight the reasons why psychological researchers cannot avoid asking them.},

To validate the method, we apply it to U.S. preelection polls for 1988 and 1992, poststratified by state, region, and the usual demographic variables. We evaluate the model by comparing it to state-level election outcomes. The multilevel model outperforms more commonly used models in political science.

The data come from undergraduate university students and are pooled from a study that was repeated at two consecutive years. Individual differences in level and change in mood was modeled with a random intercept and random slope where the residual within-person variability was allowed to vary across participants. Additionally changes in within-person variability were explained by the inclusion of a time-varying predictor indicating the severity of daily stressors. This model accounted for 2 location and 2 scale effects and provided evidence that individuals who reported higher severity in daily stressors also exhibited greater variability in affect\textemdash but only for participants who showed low overall affect variability and who reported low average negative affect. Those who were more variable in their affect reports overall were less reactive to daily stressors in the sense that their high levels of affect variability remained high. We describe the utility of this model for further research on individual variation and change.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings ({$\leq$} .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

Beyond these natural processes and events, external forces and interventions instigate and disrupt change: test scores may rise after a coaching course, drug abusers may remain abstinent after residential treatment. By charting changes over time and investigating whether and when events occur, researchers reveal the temporal rhythms of our lives. Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis is a much-needed professional book for empirical researchers and graduate students in the behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences. It offers the first accessible in-depth presentation of two of today's most popular statistical methods: multilevel models for individual change and hazard/survival models for event occurrence (in both discrete- and continuous-time). Using clear, concise prose and real data sets from published studies, the authors take you step by step through complete analyses, from simple exploratory displays that reveal underlying patterns through sophisticated specifications of complex statistical models.Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis offers readers a private consultation session with internationally recognized experts and represents a unique contribution to the literature on quantitative empirical methods.Visit http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/examples/alda.htm for:DT Downloadable data setsDT Library of computer programs in SAS, SPSS, Stata, HLM, MLwiN, and moreDT Additional material for data analysis},

  abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the `hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

  abstract = {Explanations for primate brain expansion and the evolution of human cognition and culture remain contentious despite extensive research. While multiple comparative analyses have investigated variation in brain size across primate species, very few have addressed why primates vary in how much they use social learning. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that the enhanced reliance on socially transmitted behavior observed in some primates has coevolved with enlarged brains, complex sociality, and extended lifespans. Using recently developed phylogenetic comparative methods we show that, across primate species, a measure of social learning proclivity increases with absolute and relative brain volume, longevity (specifically reproductive lifespan), and social group size, correcting for research effort. We also confirm relationships of absolute and relative brain volume with longevity (both juvenile period and reproductive lifespan) and social group size, although longevity is generally the stronger predictor. Relationships between social learning, brain volume, and longevity remain when controlling for maternal investment and are therefore not simply explained as a by-product of the generally slower life history expected for larger brained species. Our findings suggest that both brain expansion and high reliance on culturally transmitted behavior coevolved with sociality and extended lifespan in primates. This coevolution is consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of large brains, sociality, and long lifespans has promoted reliance on culture, with reliance on culture in turn driving further increases in brain volume, cognitive abilities, and lifespans in some primate lineages.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {Many species with complex life histories can respond to risk by adaptively altering the timing of key life history switch points, including hatching. It is generally thought that such hatching plasticity involves a trade-off between embryonic and hatchling predation risk, e.g., hatching early to escape egg predation comes at the cost of increased vulnerability to hatchling predators. However, most empirical work has focused on simply detecting predator-induced hatching responses or on the short-term consequences of hatching plasticity. Short-term studies may not allow sufficient time for hatchlings to exhibit compensatory responses, which may extend to subsequent life stages and could alter the nature of the trade-offs associated with hatching plasticity. In this study, we examine the consequences of predator-induced hatching plasticity through the larval stage to metamorphosis in the East African reed frog, Hyperolius spinigularis. To do this we conducted an experiment in which we manipulated initial larval size and density (mimicking the effects of egg predators) and the presence of aquatic predators. We expected that predator-induced hatchlings (because they are less developed and smaller) would experience higher per capita predation rates and a longer larval period and thus would exhibit lower survival to metamorphosis in the presence of aquatic predators than larger, more developed, later hatched larvae. Surprisingly, we found that predator-induced hatchlings survived better, not worse, than hatchlings from undisturbed clutches. These results motivated us to develop a model parameterized from additional experiments to explore whether a combination of mechanisms, compensatory growth, and density- and size-specific predation, could give rise to this pattern. Predicted survival probabilities from the model with compensatory growth were consistent with those from the field experiment: early hatched larvae grew more rapidly through vulnerable size classes than later hatched larvae, resulting in higher survival at metamorphosis. Thus, in this system, there does not appear to be a trade-off in vulnerability between egg and larval predators. Instead, our results suggest that the cost that balances the survival benefit of hatching early to evade egg predators arises later in the life history, as a result of smaller size at metamorphosis.},

  abstract = {Intensive longitudinal studies and experience sampling methods are becoming more common in psychology. While they provide a unique opportunity to ask novel questions about within-person processes relating to personality, there is a lack of methods specifically built to characterize the interplay between traits and states. We thus introduce a Bayesian multivariate mixed-effects location scale model (M-MELSM). The formulation can simultaneously model both personality traits (the location) and states (the scale) for multivariate data common to personality research. Variables can be included to predict either (or both) the traits and states, in addition to estimating random effects therein. This provides correlations between location and scale random effects, both across and within each outcome, which allows for characterizing relations between any number personality traits and the corresponding states. We take a \textbackslash textit\{fully\} Bayesian approach, not only to make estimation possible, but also because  it provides the necessary information for use in psychological applications such as hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model we use data from 194 individuals that provided daily ratings of negative and positive affect, as well as their psychical activity in the form of step counts over 100 consecutive days. We describe the fitted model, where we emphasize, with visualization, the richness of information provided by the M-MELSM. We demonstrate Bayesian hypothesis testing for the correlations between the random effects. We conclude by discussing limitations of the MELSM in general and extensions to the M-MELSM specifically for personality research.},

  abstract = {We present a Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects location scale model (NL-MELSM). The NL-MELSM allows for fitting nonlinear functions to the location, or individual means, and the scale, or within-person variance. Specifically, in the context of learning, this model allows the within-person variance to follow a nonlinear trajectory, where it can be determined whether variability reduces during learning. It incorporates a sub-model that can predict nonlinear parameters for both the location and scale. This specification estimates random effects for all nonlinear location and scale parameters that are drawn from a common multivariate distribution. This allows estimation of covariances among the random effects, within and across the location and the scale. These covariances offer new insights into the interplay between individual mean structures and intra-individual variability in nonlinear parameters. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only for ease of estimation but also for inference because it provides the necessary and consistent information for use in psychological applications, such as model selection and hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model, we use data from 333 individuals, consisting of three age groups, who participated in five learning trials that assessed verbal memory. In an exploratory context, we demonstrate that fitting a nonlinear function to the within-person variance, and allowing for individual variation therein, improves predictive accuracy compared to customary modeling techniques (e.g., assuming constant variance). We conclude by discussing the usefulness, limitations, and future directions of the NL-MELSM.},

  abstract = {Measurement reliability is a fundamental concept in psychology. It is traditionally considered a stable property of a questionnaire, measurement device, or experimental task. 
Although intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) are often used to assess reliability in repeated measure designs, their descriptive nature depends upon the assumption of a common
within-person variance.
This work focuses on the presumption that each individual is adequately described by the average within-person variance in hierarchical models. And thus whether reliability generalizes to the individual level, which leads directly into the notion of individually varying ICCs. In particular, we introduce a novel approach, using the Bayes factor, wherein a researcher can directly test for homogeneous within-person variance in hierarchical models. Additionally, we introduce a membership model that allows for classifying which (and how many) individuals belong to the common variance model. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated on cognitive inhibition tasks. We find that heterogeneous within-person variance is a defining feature of these tasks, and in one case, the ratio between the largest to smallest within-person variance exceeded 20. This translates into a 10 fold difference in person-specific reliability! We also find that few individuals belong to the common variance model, and thus traditional reliability indices are potentially masking important individual variation. We discuss the implications of our findings and possible future directions. The methods are implemented in the R package vICC.},

  abstract = {Mixed-effects models are becoming common in psychological science. Although they have many desirable features, there is still untapped potential that has not yet been fully realized. It is customary to view homogeneous variance as an assumption to satisfy. We argue to move beyond that perspective, and to view modeling within-person variance (``noise'') as an opportunity to gain a richer understanding of psychological processes. This can provide important insights into behavioral (in)stability. The technique to do so is based on the mixed-effects location scale model. The formulation can simultaneously estimate mixed-effects sub-models to both the mean (location) and within-person variance (scale) for clustered data common to psychology. We develop a framework that goes beyond assessing the sub-models in isolation of one another, and allows for testing structural relations between the mean and within-person variance with the Bayes factor. We first present a motivating example, which makes clear how the model can characterize mean\textendash variance relations. We then apply the method to reaction times gathered from two cognitive inference tasks. We find there are more individual differences in the within-person variance than the mean structure, as well as a complex web of structural mean\textendash variance relations in the random effects. This stands in contrast to the dominant view of within-person variance\textendash i.e., measurement ``error'' or ``noise.'' The results also point towards paradoxical within-person, as opposed to between-person, effects. That is, in both tasks, several people had \textbackslash emph\{slower\} and \textbackslash emph\{less\} variable incongruent responses. This contradicts the typical pattern, wherein \textbackslash emph\{larger\} means are expected to be \textbackslash emph\{more\} variable. We conclude with future directions. These span from methodological to theoretical inquires that can be answered with the presented methodology.}

Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology's near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism, but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions.

  abstract = {Ggtree is an R/Bioconductor package for visualizing tree-like structures and associated data. After 5 years of continual development, ggtree has been evolved as a package suite that contains treeio for tree data input and output, tidytree for tree data manipulation, and ggtree for tree data visualization. Ggtree was originally designed to work with phylogenetic trees, and has been expanded to support other tree-like structures, which extends the application of ggtree to present tree data in other disciplines. This article contains five basic protocols describing how to visualize trees using the grammar of graphics syntax, how to visualize hierarchical clustering results with associated data, how to estimate bootstrap values and visualize the values on the tree, how to estimate continuous and discrete ancestral traits and visualize ancestral states on the tree, and how to visualize a multiple sequence alignment with a phylogenetic tree. The ggtree package is freely available at https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/ggtree. \textcopyright{} 2020 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {While there are various model selection methods, an unanswered but important question is how to select one of them for data at hand. The difficulty is due to that the targeted behaviors of the model selection procedures depend heavily on uncheckable or difficult-to-check assumptions on the data generating process. Fortunately, cross-validation (CV) provides a general tool to solve this problem. In this work, results are provided on how to apply CV to consistently choose the best method, yielding new insights and guidance for potentially vast amount of application. In addition, we address several seemingly widely spread misconceptions on CV.},
